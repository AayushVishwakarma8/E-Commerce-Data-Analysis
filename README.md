E-Commerce Data Analysis with Power BI and MySQL
This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from an E-Commerce dataset using Power BI and MySQL. The project integrates MySQL data into Power BI, performs extensive data analysis, and generates various dashboards to gain actionable insights. SQL queries were used for data extraction, transformation, and some calculations before importing the data into Power BI for visualization.

Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing key aspects of an e-commerce business using sales, customer, order, product, and supplier data. Multiple dashboards were created to extract insights and guide decision-making, including customer insights, product performance, supplier performance, sales trends, and more.

Key Features
Data Integration with MySQL:

The raw data is stored in a MySQL database.
Queries were performed to extract and transform the data into a usable format for analysis in Power BI.
Power BI Dashboards:

Customer Insights Dashboard: Analyzes customer behavior, churn risk, and segmentation.
Sales Dashboard: Tracks sales performance, growth trends, and contribution by product and category.
Product Performance Dashboard: Analyzes product pricing, discounts, and sales performance by category.
Supplier Insights Dashboard: Focuses on supplier performance and revenue contribution.
Category Insights Dashboard: Displays the performance and growth of different product categories.
SQL Queries:

SQL was used for various data manipulations and transformations, such as:
Calculating churn risk for customers.
Extracting total revenue and profit by category and supplier.
Creating necessary joins between tables (Orders, OrderDetails, Products, Suppliers, etc.).
Deriving insights such as sales growth, price comparisons, and category performance.
Data Overview
The dataset consists of the following tables:

Customers: Contains customer details such as CustomerID, Name, Address, and Date of Birth.
Orders: Contains order-related information such as OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, DeliveryDate, and Total Order Amount.
OrderDetails: Details of the products ordered, including OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, and SupplierID.
Products: Contains product-related data such as ProductID, CategoryID, Sale Price, Market Price, and SupplierID.
Suppliers: Contains information on suppliers like SupplierID, Company Name, Contact Info, and Location.
Categories: Contains product categories, linked to Products by CategoryID.
Analysis and Insights
1. Customer Insights
Churn Risk: Analyzed the risk of customer churn by calculating the time since their last order and identifying high-risk customers.
Segmentation: Grouped customers into segments based on their purchase behavior, region, and other demographic factors.
Lifetime Value: Estimated customer lifetime value by analyzing their past spending and frequency of orders.
2. Sales Insights
Revenue by Category: Total revenue generated by each category was calculated using the SUMX DAX function.
Profit by Category: Profits were derived by comparing sale prices with market prices.
Top Products and Categories: The top-selling products and categories were identified, focusing on units sold and revenue.
3. Product Performance
Price Analysis: Compared sale prices to market prices to identify discount percentages and pricing strategies for each product and supplier.
Performance by Supplier: Evaluated revenue and sales contributions by suppliers to understand their market share.
Sales Growth: Analyzed sales growth by comparing sales data from 2020 and 2021.
4. Supplier Insights
Revenue Contribution: Calculated how much revenue each supplier contributes to the overall sales.
Supplier Performance: Identified high-performing suppliers based on the products they offer and their revenue generation.
5. Category Insights
Category Revenue: Calculated revenue for each category by aggregating sales across products.
Category Growth: Analyzed growth trends of different categories over time.
Discount Analysis: Compared sale prices to market prices across categories to determine discount strategies.
SQL Queries Used
Some of the important SQL queries performed include:

Churn Risk Calculation:

SQL queries to calculate the days since the last purchase for each customer and flag them as high or low risk for churn.
Revenue Calculation:

SQL queries to join tables and calculate total revenue and profit for products and categories.
Sales Growth:

SQL queries to calculate the growth in sales and revenue between different time periods (e.g., comparing 2020 to 2021).
Discount Calculation:

SQL queries to calculate the percentage discount between the sale price and the market price for each product.
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Used for data visualization, creating dashboards, and performing advanced calculations with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
MySQL: Used for querying and extracting the data from the database.
DAX: Used for creating calculated columns, measures, and insights within Power BI.
